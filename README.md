# WORK IN PROGRESS

## Little Slack

* My very first MERN -project, done for learning.

* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Installing

* You need Mongodb to run this app
* Clone the repo
* Install dependencies: "npm install"
* Run program: "npm start"
* (npm start will start both front- and backend)
* More instructions to follow...

## Separate Starting Commands

* "npm start" will start both front- and backend
* "node src/server.js" will start only backend

## Default ports and REST API

* Frontend will be as an default on http://localhost:3000/
* Backend will be as an default on http://localhost:4200/
* REST api can be found from http://localhost:4200/api/

## Future Development

* Consider using React Bootstrap?
